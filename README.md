# üé≠ Gravatars in Sitecore Experience Profile

This repository contains code for displaying [Gravatars][1] in the Sitecore
Experience Profile that [Rick Bauer][2] and I demonstrated in our _JavaScript
Services & Marketing Automation_ and _Crank Up Your Sitecore Authoring and
Marketing Experience_ presentations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation

There are two ways to integrate Gravatar with the Experience Profile:

1. Override the `IContactService` that the Experience Profile uses to retrieve
   a contact's avatar when the Experience Profile loads; and/or
2. Write to the contact's `Avatar` facet at some point in their journey with
   your website.

The first option will add Gravatar to _all_ contacts in the Experience Profile
as it does not require you to write to the `Avatar` facet of your contacts. The
second option makes the contact's Gravatar available anywhere you use the
`Avatar` facet in your site.

At a minimum I recommend implementing the first option in your Sitecore
solutions. The second option is nice for new Sitecore installs, but probably not
practical for existing solutions with lots of existing contacts. Both options
are compatible with each other.

See the code in the [Experience Profile feature module][3] to see how you can
integrate a [`GravatarService`][4] into the `IContactService` to load the
Gravatar for _all_ contacts in the Experience Profile that don't have the
`Avatar` facet set.

See the code in the [`ContactRepository`][5] of the [Website project module][6]
to see how to set the `Avatar` facet on contacts using Gravatar.

## üèóÔ∏è Setup

### üê≥ Docker

1. Build the Sitecore 9.3 docker images using the steps in the
   [Sitecore Docker images repository][7].
2. Build the solution with the `Docker` build configuration.
3. All projects in the solution will be automatically published to Docker on
   build courtesy of [Helix Publishing Pipeline][8].
4. On the command line:
   1. `cd C:\[path-to]\sitecore-improved-page-attribute-controls`
   2. `docker-compose up`

### üíΩ Locally

1. Install a new instance of [Sitecore 9.3][9].
2. Update the `publishUrl` in [`PublishSettings.Sitecore.targets`][10] to your
   Sitecore installation's web root (e.g., `C:\inetpub\wwwroot\sc93.sc`).
3. Update the `sourceFolder` in [`CoreyAndRick.Project.Common.Dev.config`][11] to
   point to the root of this repository on your disk.
4. Build the solution with the `Debug` build configuration.
5. All projects in the solution will be automatically published to Sitecore on
   build courtesy of [Helix Publishing Pipeline][8].
